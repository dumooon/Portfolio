			<h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
			<h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
			<p>When I first started learning web development, I quickly realized that the most important thing is to have a deep understanding of fundamental technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I now have a solid understanding of these technologies and have experience working with them.
			</p>
			<p>In addition, I have learned Vue3, which is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks for building modern web applications, and I have experience working with Vuex, which is a powerful tool for managing application state.</p>
			<p>I'm also familiar with Git, which is an indispensable tool for version control and collaboration on software projects.</p>
			<p>Although I don't have any commercial development experience yet, I have created several projects using Vue3 that demonstrate my skills and abilities. I'm always striving to improve and learn new technologies to ensure the highest quality of work and efficient software development.</p>

					<h4>Frelance</h4>
					<p>My most successful project to date involved the use of several technologies, including Vuex, Router, and i18n, with data stored in local storage. Although initially conceived as a mini-freelance exchange, it evolved into a note-taking app. *While the site may sometimes display a 404 error due to some deployment issues, it functions perfectly fine locally.</p>

					<h4>2048</h4>
					<p>The well-known game 2048. During this period, I honed my skills in working with vanilla JavaScript and completed a project in just one day. To be honest, I didn't enjoy coding it. *Doesn’t work on mobile devices</p>

					<h4>Weight</h4>
					<p>Here you can monitor changes in your body weight.I worked on a project where I familiarized myself with the chart.js library. Though it wasn't a complex project, it was intriguing to experiment with building charts and graphs.</p>

					<h4>Portfolio</h4>
					<p>Here I made a resume application. In this project, I gained experience working with databases by validating and sending requests, as well as retrieving and rendering data on the site. *I used Firebase for this, but the subscription only lasts for a month, so I try to keep it updated but sometimes forget to do so.</p>
